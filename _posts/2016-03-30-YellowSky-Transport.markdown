This was an order from a London delivery company. They are specialized in "man and van" services.

The main focus here was to build a form in the most user-friendly way.

This work was made at The Nodehub, were I was working since Apr 2015 until Apr 2016.

My tasks here were:

* To rethink the old design.

* Make some proofs of concept and show them to the costumer.

* Make the *Twig* templates for *Synfony*.

* Style the whole site (using *susy*, a sass framework).

* Make the UX study and apply the results.
