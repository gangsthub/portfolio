This is the type of work I usually made at The Nodehub, were I was working since Apr 2015 until Apr 2016. Given a custom design, style a Drupal site. Mainly CSS (SASS), but also JS. And sometimes, some Drupal modules editing.

My tasks here were:

* Styling a given design, made by a design studio called <a href="http://detalier.com/" rel="nofollow" target="blank_">Detalier</a>.

* Cross-Browser respoonvie testing.

I would highligt a copue of things about this website:

* Fortunately, I had a good design from start, wich is really appreciated. Based on **grids**. And I had good relationship with the designers, who also had some web dev knowledge, so we could understand each other.

* I tried to apply here the best performance techniques doing this design. I would mark as a milestone the **2-levels responsive menu**. I used some <a href="https://twitter.com/aerotwist" target="blank_">Paul Lewis</a> animation advices there.
