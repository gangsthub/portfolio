The funiest thing I made at The NodeHub was this *xmass*.

This work was made at The Nodehub, were I was working since Apr 2015 until Apr 2016.

My tasks here were:

* To Draw the charcters (and prepare all the assets) based on "Adventure Times" TV Show.

* Animate the whole sequence using the amazing lib <a href="https://greensock.com/tweenmax" rel="nofollow"><em>TweenMax</em></a> from *GSAP* for JS animations.
